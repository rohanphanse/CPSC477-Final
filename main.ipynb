      "[INST] You are a financial advisor tasked with creating a short summary of an earnings call transcript. You only want to summarize or re-iterate points that would be relevant, critical, or informational to someone who wants to skim over the important details of a long transcript. Below is an earnings call transcript.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earnings Call Transcript:\n",
      " On the call are Jeff Mezger, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Matt Mandino, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Kaminski, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bill Hollinger, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Thad Johnson, Senior Vice President and Treasurer.\r\n",
      "And with that, here is Jeff Mezger.\r\n",
      "We delivered healthy results in the second quarter marked by one of the strongest quarters for both operating and gross margin performance in some time.\r\n",
      "Operationally, our divisions are doing an excellent job of navigating this environment of demand strength and well-publicized supply chain constraints as we effectively balance pace, price and starts to optimize our assets and manage our production.\r\n",
      "With our full year coming into better view, we are poised for continued returns-focused growth expanding our scale to about $6 billion in revenues and generating a return on equity of roughly 20%.\r\n",
      "As for the details of the quarter, we produced total revenues of $1.44 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.50.\r\n",
      "We achieved an operating income margin of 11.3% driven by several factors.\r\n",
      "In addition to strong market conditions, we are benefiting from solid performance in our newer communities, operating leverage from both the increase in our community absorption rate as well as overall higher revenues, disciplined management of our SG&A costs and the ongoing tailwind from lower interest amortization.\r\n",
      "Our profitability per unit grew meaningfully on a sequential basis to nearly $47,000.\r\n",
      "We achieved or surpassed our expectations across our financial metrics, although deliveries were at the low end of our range as some of our deliveries shifted into the third quarter due to supply shortages and municipal delays.\r\n",
      "That said, with the benefit of local scale in most of our divisions, we are relying on our long-standing relationships with subcontractors and trade partners to mitigate delays.\r\n",
      "With the progression of our work in process and our success in accelerating starts, we are confident in our ability to achieve full-year deliveries of between 14,000 and 14,500 homes.\r\n",
      "Our balance sheet is solid.\r\n",
      "Having worked through the bulk of our inactive assets, our inventory has rotated into a higher-quality portfolio of communities.\r\n",
      "We have grown our equity while reducing our debt resulting in a significantly lower leverage ratio, which we expect will decline further by year-end.\r\n",
      "We recently completed a $390 million debt offering, the net proceeds from which together with a portion of our existing cash will be used to retire our '21 maturity in full.\r\n",
      "Ultimately the offering will contribute to a reduction of our debt levels and lower our average borrowing rate, providing an ongoing tailwind to our future margins.\r\n",
      "We continue to allocate the substantial cash we are generating in a consistent manner prioritizing our future growth to drive greater earnings and returns.\r\n",
      "In addition, our balanced approach includes returning cash to stockholders, primarily through our quarterly dividend, which we have raised in each of the past few years and reducing our debt, as I just mentioned.\r\n",
      "In the second quarter, we invested $575 million in land acquisition and development, expanding our lot position sequentially by 7,800 lots to roughly 77,500 lots owned or controlled with 45% of the total optioned.\r\n",
      "This growth in active inventory, together with improving margins, should help to drive further improvement in our return on equity.\r\n",
      "As we discussed last quarter, we are assuming a lower monthly absorption in our underwriting as compared to our current pace and no inflation either in ASP or costs.\r\n",
      "In addition, we are pursuing moderately sized deals in our preferred submarkets averaging between 100 and 150 lots and staying on strategy and positioning these new communities to be attainable near the median household income for that sub-market.\r\n",
      "We believe using this disciplined approach helps to manage our risk as we acquire land throughout this cycle.\r\n",
      "While we expect our near-term growth to come primarily from our existing markets as we work to gain market share and expand our scale, we are also selectively entering new markets.\r\n",
      "Along with our success in Seattle and recent reentry into Charlotte, we are announcing today that we have started up a division in Boise, Idaho, a top 25 housing market.\r\n",
      "We see a meaningful opportunity in this fast-growing metro area to offer our personalized homes at affordable prices and we are excited about extending our market strategy to Boise.\r\n",
      "We now have over 900 lots under control and anticipate our first land parcel closing in the third quarter.\r\n",
      "We successfully opened 33 new communities in the second quarter.\r\n",
      "However, as a result of the heightened demand for our homes, we sold out more communities than we had projected and also experienced slippage in some community openings.\r\n",
      "Jeff will provide more detail on our community count expectations for this year in a moment.\r\n",
      "Looking forward to 2022 with our strong lot pipeline, we remain on track for double-digit year-over-year community count growth.\r\n",
      "As we prepare for the significant acceleration of new community openings over the next six quarters, we have also stayed focused on building our backlog to drive our revenues for the balance of this year and into 2022.\r\n",
      "Our monthly absorption rate rose to seven net orders per community during the second quarter, even as we managed sales primarily through price increases and secondarily through lot releases in order to balance pace, price and starts.\r\n",
      "We are sensitive to affordability as we work to stay within appropriate range near the median household income of each submarket.\r\n",
      "Our order ASP has climbed in the past three months, reflecting a combination of mix as well as rising prices.\r\n",
      "Our largest sequential net order increase was in our West Coast region.\r\n",
      "Although this region carries our highest average selling price, it remains competitive with resales within our submarkets.\r\n",
      "Our Los Angeles/Ventura business provides a good example.\r\n",
      "This division generated the strongest sequential order growth in the second quarter.\r\n",
      "And although it operates at a higher ASP, it is still below the median resale price of homes in its submarkets which are as much as $100,000 higher and selling within a few weeks of being listed.\r\n",
      "Resale prices have moved significantly and our relative position has actually been enhanced.\r\n",
      "As to lot releases, our approach is similar to how we gauge interest in a new community.\r\n",
      "Homebuyers complete an application and go through their initial credit process to join a list of qualified buyers.\r\n",
      "We then work through that list as we release lots.\r\n",
      "We are typically raising prices in conjunction with each lot release and have not seen a decrease in the conversion of qualified buyers even as base prices have risen.\r\n",
      "Our teams work hard to earn our place as the number one customer ranked national homebuilder in third party customer satisfaction surveys by prioritizing service and the relationships we have with our buyers and we're focused on continuing to do so during this time of limited supply.\r\n",
      "The metrics that we monitor internally for shifts in affordability are stable.\r\n",
      "Buyers are not adjusting the size of the homes they are purchasing to stay in the market.\r\n",
      "Although we offer floor plans below 1,600 square feet in over 75% of our communities, buyers are still selecting homes averaging 2,100 feet, which is consistent with their choices over the past couple of years.\r\n",
      "As is evident in our results, the desire for homeownership is strong and we believe will remain so for the foreseeable future.\r\n",
      "There are two primary factors in forming our view.\r\n",
      "The first is an acute shortage of supply stemming not only from limited resale inventory, but also from the under production of new homes over the past 15 years.\r\n",

The company delivered strong results, with an operating income margin of 11.3% and a profitability per unit of nearly $47,000. The company's balance sheet is solid, with a lower leverage ratio and a reduction in debt levels expected by year-end. The company is investing in land acquisition and development, expanding its lot position and active inventory, and pursuing a disciplined approach to managing risk. The company is also entering new markets, including Boise, Idaho, and has recently started up a division in this fast-growing metro area.

      " KB Home delivered a strong second quarter, driven by solid operational performance and favorable market conditions. The company achieved diluted earnings per share of $1.50, exceeding analysts' estimates. Total revenues rose 58% to $1.44 billion, largely attributed to a surge in housing revenues, which witnessed a 40% increase. KB Home experienced a robust surge in net orders, reaching a 14-year high for the second quarter, and its backlog grew significantly by 126% to $4.3 billion. The company's profitability metrics improved, with an operating income margin of 11.3% and a gross profit margin of 21.4%. This success was driven by disciplined pricing, operating leverage, and lower interest amortization. Despite facing challenges with supply shortages and municipal delays, KB Home remains confident in achieving its full-year targets. The company anticipates revenues ranging from $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion and expects to expand its operating margin to a range of 11.5% to 12%. KB Home remains committed to returning cash to stockholders through dividends and reducing its debt burden. With a solid balance sheet, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities in the future.</s>\n",
